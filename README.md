README 

This EDA Dashboard is a lightweight, interactive analytics application built with Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas. It’s designed to make exploring the Sample Superstore dataset simple and intuitive. I wanted to create something that could give users the ability to filter data by region, state, city, and date range while instantly updating all visualizations on the screen. The dashboard includes category level and region level sales information, a time series view of the monthly performance, a hierarchical treemap for drilling down into product segments, and a scatterplot that shows the relationship between sales and profit. All tables are styled for readability, and any filtered dataset can be downloaded with one click. The layout follows a clean, modern dark-theme aesthetic inspired by professional finance dashboards. The app runs entirely locally, requires no external APIs, and accepts both uploaded files and a bundled Superstore.csv dataset. By combining quick interaction with clear visuals, this project offers a fast and user-friendly way to perform exploratory data analysis without writing a single line of code.
